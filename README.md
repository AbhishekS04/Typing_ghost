# **Typing Ghost**

Typing Ghost is an advanced typing platform designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. The app features user authentication through Clerk, a typing test to assess skills, and tracking of individual user performance over time.

## **Features**
- User authentication using Clerk.
- Typing tests that provide feedback on speed and accuracy.
- User-specific typing history and performance tracking.
- Real-time feedback on typing accuracy.
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop.
  
## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage (or database-ready)
- **Build/Bundle**: Vite or React Scripts

## **Getting Started**

To get Typing Ghost up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Clerk account for authentication (sign up at [Clerk](https://clerk.dev))

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-ghost.git
   cd typing-ghost
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Clerk**:
   - Sign up on [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) and create a new project.
   - Copy your **Frontend API key** from your Clerk project.
   - Update the `src/App.tsx` with your Clerk Frontend API key:
     ```tsx
     const clerkFrontendApi = "your_clerk_frontend_api";
     ```

4. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## **Folder Structure**

Here’s an overview of Typing Ghost's project structure:

├── components/
│   ├── Caret.tsx
│   ├── GeneratedWords.tsx

```

### Key Files:
- **App.tsx**: The main entry point of your app where Clerk authentication is initialized.
- **components/**: Contains the main UI components for typing tests, history, results, etc.
- **hooks/**: Custom hooks for handling typing logic like countdown, word management, and input handling.
- **utils/helpers.ts**: Helper functions for saving and retrieving user typing history.

---

## **Usage**

1. **Sign in or sign up** using Clerk's authentication system.
2. Once logged in, users can start the typing test to assess their typing speed and accuracy.
3. After completing the test, users will see their accuracy and typing speed.
4. The typing history is saved and shown in the "Typing History" section under **User Typings**.

---

## **Clerk Authentication**

Typing Ghost uses Clerk for secure user authentication.

### Steps:
1. **Sign up for Clerk** at [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev).
2. **Set up Clerk in your app**:
   - Wrap your app with the `ClerkProvider`.
   - Use `SignedIn` and `SignedOut` components to protect routes.
   - Clerk handles user sign-in, sign-up, and profile management automatically.

Here’s an example of integrating Clerk in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<ClerkProvider frontendApi={clerkFrontendApi}>
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<SignedIn><Home /></SignedIn>} />
      <Route path="/sign-in" element={<RedirectToSignIn />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
</ClerkProvider>
```

## **Typing Activity Tracking**

Typing Ghost tracks user typing performance, including accuracy and the completion date of tests.

### How it Works:
- When a user finishes a typing test, the result (including accuracy and date) is stored.
- Data is saved in `localStorage` (for now), but it can be extended to store data in a backend or database.
- The **User Typings** component fetches and displays the typing history of the currently logged-in user.

Here’s an example of saving typing activity:

In `helpers.ts`:
```ts
export const saveTypingActivity = (userId: string, accuracy: number) => {
  const typingData = {
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    accuracy,
  };
  const existingHistory = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(userId) || "[]");
  existingHistory.push(typingData);
  localStorage.setItem(userId, JSON.stringify(existingHistory));
};

export const getUserTypingHistory = (userId: string) => {
  return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(userId) || "[]");
};
```
